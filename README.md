## 🚀 How I built this
This game uses a 3D coordinate system where:
- **X-axis:** Moves the panda left and right.
- **Z-axis:** Moves the panda forward across the river.
- **Collision Logic:** The game checks if the panda's position matches a log's position. If it doesn't while in the river zone... **SPLASH!**
